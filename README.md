Simple program that asks for an upper bounds and how ever many numbers to check divisibility, from 1 to the upper bounds. 
We ask for an upper bounds (int), how many pairs of numbers/return type, and then individual values to find the divisibility and the return value. 
If a number between 1 and the upper bounds is divisible, we add the respective return value to the output. After all numbers are checked 
for each value to mod by, the rest of the output is filled with it's respective value between 1 and upper bounds.
